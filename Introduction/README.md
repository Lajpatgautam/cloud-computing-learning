🌩️ What Is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing refers to using computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software through the internet instead of owning physical hardware.

Rather than buying and maintaining servers on your own premises, cloud users access resources hosted on remote data centers. These resources are available on demand, and users are charged only for what they actually consume.
In simple words, cloud computing allows applications and data to run on online servers instead of local machines.

Scalability
Resources can be increased or reduced easily based on workload.

Elasticity
Systems automatically adjust capacity when demand changes.

High Availability
Services remain accessible with minimal downtime.

Agility
Resources can be provisioned quickly within minutes.

Fault Tolerance
Applications continue working even if a component fails.

Disaster Recovery
Data and applications can be restored after failures or disasters.

Pay-As-You-Go Pricing
Users pay only for the resources they use.

🔹 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

More control is given to the user

Cloud provider manages hardware and virtualization

User manages OS, applications, and data

Common use cases:

Virtual machines

Testing and development

Application migration

Examples:

AWS EC2

Azure Virtual Machines🔹 Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

More control is given to the user

Cloud provider manages hardware and virtualization

User manages OS, applications, and data

Common use cases:

Virtual machines

Testing and development

Application migration

Examples:

AWS EC2

Azure Virtual Machines

🔹 Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Responsibilities are shared

Provider manages OS, runtime, and infrastructure

User focuses only on application code

Ideal for:

Application development

Example:

Heroku

🔹 Software as a Service (SaaS)

Provider manages everything

Users access applications via browser

No installation required

Examples:

Gmail

Outlook

Microsoft 365

OneDrive


🔐 Shared Responsibility Model

The shared responsibility model explains who is responsible for what in cloud security.

Cloud Provider → Infrastructure, physical security, and underlying services

Customer → Data, user access, configurations, and applications

📌 Responsibility depends on whether you use IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS.
