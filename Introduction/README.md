🌩️ What Is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing refers to using computing resources such as servers, storage, databases, networking, and software through the internet instead of owning physical hardware.

Rather than buying and maintaining servers on your own premises, cloud users access resources hosted on remote data centers. These resources are available on demand, and users are charged only for what they actually consume.
In simple words, cloud computing allows applications and data to run on online servers instead of local machines.
